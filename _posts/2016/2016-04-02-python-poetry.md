Long time, no blogging! To say I haven't been blogging lately because I've been busy wouldn't be entirely true, I just haven't found anything fun to write about.

 I lay awake the other night and thought, I gotta write SOMETHING!. Then it struck me: _Python poetry_. Billion dollar idea, right? Perhaps not, but I feel that I owe much of my self-proclaimed prowess as a developer to the [Python language](https://www.python.org/). Lately I've been using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) more and more in cases I would have used Python, had you asked me some years ago. That's why I wanted to write this poem as an homage to how much Python has helped me out. Here it goes:

> I started out coding, some five years ago,
> the language was MATLAB, though I wish it was Go.

I don't think [Go](https://golang.org/) existed when I started coding (at least I had no idea it existed), but hey, it rhymes!

> I was really tired, of tough physics lore,
> I went to switch majors, to code even more.

For reference, during my first semester at NTNU, I was majoring in Applied Physics, before I switched to Communications Technology.

> I first was astounded, how simple it was,
> when I first coded Python, I felt like a boss!

> At first it was for-loops, and functions and such,
> And then there was Django, which assisted me much.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is really what taught me to develop web applications, which is what has become my bread and butter (in the future, hopefully, at least) as a career developer. However, it is important to expand one's horizon as a developer:

> While Python has helped me, to get good with code,
> lately I've tended to do more with node(.js)

The .js in node.js is silent, right?

That does it for this time. I hope you had fun reading this (it was fun to write, at least!). Until next time!
